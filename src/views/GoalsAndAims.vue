    <h1>Goals and Aims</h1>
    <p>
        Much of what we are doing here was encouraged by reading the book Show Your Work, that is to say we’d contemplated the idea of sharing before, but the points made in that text really convinced us it was a good idea to pursue seriously. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To that end we’re doing our rough drafts semi-live on the website (still editing offline for spellcheck and such, not using the code editor for mass writing efforts, but everyday uploading the unfinished copy to the website so the versioning history will be reflected in the git repository for the site).

        Our philosophy can be summarized with 3 Key Words: REVEAL, SOURCES, FOUND
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>REVEAL</b> - Reveal Bits and Pieces as we Recall Them (the strongest memories are the most fundamental). At the Heart of the TCT philosophy is one of personal discovery, Every Man and Every Woman Is A Star, and we endeavor to help each initiate Shine As Is Befitting Their Nature. No two individuals will read even the same paragraph in the same way, much less an entire text, and so intimate with one’s personal journey is one’s recall of that journey, the parts that stick are often the ones most formative, cataloging ones journey becomes a tool for Spiritual Reflection.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>SOURCES</b> - Tie them to source media (books, movies, albums, etc.) so others can build their own journey from your tales. Part of sharing the path as it unfolded for you is so others can learn, every single piece of media touched upon was the product of another’s creative journey, and so to we seek to let the TCT become a vehicle for initiates to learn to express their own findings through equally varied mediums, as is appropriate to the individual, as it pertains to the unfoldment of their Trued Will (more on that for Aspiring and Prospective Candidates in the Grade Papers of the Order)
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>FOUND</b> - Relate how each found you, what the earliest city you remember reading this in (place is so important, as the ideas were merely the recipes but the ingredients for what was done with those recipes came from the local landscape, AS IS ALWAYS THE CASE)
        </li>
    </ul>
