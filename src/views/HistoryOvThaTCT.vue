        A History ov tha TCT
    </p>
    <p>
        The Typhonic Craft Tradition has evolved over the course of the last three decades from an ever evolving meshwork of syncretizations, the nature of the mysteries and the length of time between then and now has some of the details more shrouded in mystery but most illustrative is the time at which different ideas became incorporated into the central mysteries of the TCT. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The founding members originally came together in Madison, WI in the year 1997 and had divergent interests in art and spirituality but ultimately found commonality through two specific avenues of interest, Chaos Magick and the Typhonian Ordo Templi Orientis (TOTO).
    </p>
    <p>
        This Tradition has grown over three decades and across multiple metropolitan centers, each lending their own influence and flavor to what has become a potent brew long steeped in experiential gnosis.
    </p>
    <p>
        As this is a syncretic tradition, it is best to trace its roots to the ideas as they became grafted into the warp and weft of the tapestry that has taken shape over the course of these journeys. Within TCT, there is an importance put not only on the ideas that inform an evolution of consciousness, but also on the Places in which those ideas are developed and explored. To this end, we would like to create a Gallery of sorts each centered on Key Sources, the ideas within those sources that came to be fundamental to the Tradition as it grew, and the Cities wherein those source ideas were first discovered and explored.
    </p>
    <p>
        We specifically are putting this into a version controlled website so we can see the thing grow as all the remembrances are filled in. Things will be shifted around as histories become clarified and uncovered anew. The version history of this document will serve as a revision history for future explorations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the founding members were originally from Madison, others ended up there while attending college in the late 90s, all believe it was more than merely happenstance and the journey is worth sharing.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the first inklings of the Tradition were starting to whisper their way into the lives of the early initiates, Germanic influenced Neo-Paganism, Traditional Crowleyan Thelema, and LaVeyan Satanism were the primary substrates which formed a fertile bed of ideas ready to be fertilized by what was to come. When first arriving in Madison, these three traditional roots were the ones which played the largest significance in the early practices. We will begin by listing sources from memory which we consider to have been fundamental, as even decades later they are burned into memory as powerful milestones along the path.
